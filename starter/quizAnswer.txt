1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
	Because middleware functions are versatile and can access the request object, the response object, and the next function, 
    they allow us to do a lot of different operations. These include executing code, making changes to the request object and the 
    response object, ending the request-response cycle, and calling the next middleware in the stack. Examples of middleware usage 
    we have seen in class so far include adding or defining properties of the request object and defining the function’s response 
    based on conditions. 
2. What does CRUD stand for? Permissions we can give access to in database
	CRUD → create, read, update, destroy/delete
3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
        1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file? 
        Place sensitive info into the .env file under a variable (in the case of this assignment MONGO_URI) and then in the 
        function to access the database you pass Process.env.MONGO_URI as the parameter. You also have to require(‘dotenv’).config (); 
        in order to make sure it connects to the dotenv npm module and runs properly. 
        2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?
           place .env into a .gitignore file
